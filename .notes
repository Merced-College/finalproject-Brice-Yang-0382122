chessBoard - double array
EVERY PIECE NEEDS THEIR OWN CLASS
moveHistory - linkedList/Stack
chessOpenings - Array of some kind?
pawnPromotion -  Perhaps needs own class for nicer documentation. Probably just some 'if' Method I can check after every turn.
findCheck - After every turn I should run this function to see if the King is in Check
findCheckMate - Similar. Except this might be more difficult.
findStalemate - Every turn. Check for Stalemate.

ASCII - If I added ASCII it wouldn't be one big Print statement.  But multiple print statements. 
    But maybe that would actually be easy within a multiarray holding characters?
Moving pieces require a POSITION CALL. THE POSITON IS CHECKED. Then a move is suggested. Check if move is valid.

CHESS NOTATION
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)

pawn.java and piece.java are not really needed I think?
    Just work with the board. Check the position. Instead of creating new literal classes.
